# Tiera-Zon

Tiera-zon is a freeware fractal generator which runs under Windows.
It was written by Stephen C. Ferguson in the late 1990s (version 2.7
is dated 09-17-98).
A graphics monitor of a least 256 colors is required, high color or
true color is prefered since it generates fractals in true-color.

The Tiera-zon program is about twice as fast as the Iterations/Flarium
programs.  The main program is written in Visual C++ and the formulae
and filters are written and included in a DLL file that is compiled
with the freeware DJGPP compiler using a Windows port software
package called RSX.

Tiera-zon currently has the following capabilities:

- About 100 formulae, mostly consisting of Newton MSet formula, Newton variations, and trig functions.
- Several enhancement filters such as stalks, bubbles, and atan methods.
- Saves images in 24-bit bmp format.
- Image processing such as blur, emboss, contour, and sharpen
- Anti-aliasing by blurring the image (low pass filtering), then reducing the image to half size.
- Fractal dimension and standard deviation coloring method.
- A unique formulae editor and parser which supports the following complex math functions:
  `*`, `/`, `+`, `-`, `^`, `sin`, `sinh`, `asin`, `cos`, `acos`, `tan`, `atan`, and `log`.
- The formula editor/ parser can be used to write your own unique formulae.
- Capability for creating AVI file video clips of zooming and/ or panning into fractals.
- Capability for creating AVI file video clips of Julia set animations. (New in version 1.5).
